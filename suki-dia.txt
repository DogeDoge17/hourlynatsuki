Seriously? You brought a boy?
Way to kill the atmosphere.
What are you looking at?
If you want to say something, say it.
Hmph.
Hey! I made them, I'll get them!
Okaaay, are you ready?
...Ta-daa!
Ehehe. Well, you know.
Just hurry and take one!
W-Why are you thanking me? It's not like I...!
...Made them for you or anything.
Well, maybe!
But not for, y-you know, 𝘺𝘰𝘶! Dummy...
You know it!
Ugh, I hate horror...
Well, I just...
Never mind.
W-What?
What gives you that idea?
Don't say it out loud!!
And give that back!
𝘐'𝘮 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘤𝘶𝘵𝘦!!
Eh? Well, I guess sometimes.
Why do you care?
N-No!
You wouldn't...like them...
...?
U-Um...
Hmph.
If you really just came for the cupcakes, I would be super pissed.
Oh, come on! Like he deserves any slack.
Sayori told me you didn't even want to join any clubs this year.
And last year, too!
I don't know if you plan to just come here and hang out, or what...
But if you don't take us seriously, then you won't see the end of it.
M-M-M...!!
Manga is literature!!
(𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵'𝘴 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘨𝘦...?)
Oh, it's nothing.
I guess you could say it's fancy.
Cute?
Did you completely miss the symbolism or something?
It's clearly about the feeling of giving up.
How can that be cute?
Eh?
You mean you have to try that hard to come up with something nice to say?
Thanks, but it really didn't come out nice at all!
Hmph.
If I was looking for suggestions, I would have asked someone who actually liked it.
Which people 𝘥𝘪𝘥, by the way.
Sayori liked it.
And [player] did, too!
And [player] did, too!
And [player] did, too!
So based on that, I'll gladly give you some suggestions of my own.
First of all--
Nn...!
Oh?
Huh! And how do you know he didn't appreciate 𝘮𝘺 advice more?
Are you that full of yourself?
Uuuuuu...!
Well, you know what?!
I wasn't the one whose boobs magically grew a size bigger as soon as [player] started showing up!!
I wasn't the one whose boobs magically grew a size bigger as soon as [player] started showing up!!
I wasn't the one whose boobs magically grew a size bigger as soon as [player] started showing up!!
This doesn't involve you!
That's not true!
She started it!
If she could get over herself and learn to appreciate that 𝘴𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦 writing is more effective...
Then this wouldn't have happened in the first place!
What's the point in making your poems all convoluted for no reason?
The meaning should jump out at the reader, not force them to have to figure it out.
Help me explain that to her, [player]!
Help me explain that to her, [player]!
Help me explain that to her, [player]!
Well??
It was alright. Well, mostly.
...Yeah!!
It did, didn't it?!
Ahah!
Shows how much 𝘺𝘰𝘶 know!
Huh?
Me?
But she was so mean to me...!
Ah--
...Thanks for noticing.
Hey...!
It's not like you need to apologize 𝘧𝘰𝘳 me, [player].
It's not like you need to apologize 𝘧𝘰𝘳 me, [player].
It's not like you need to apologize 𝘧𝘰𝘳 me, [player].
Sheesh.
I...
The thing about...
Uu...
𝘞𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘱 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘵 𝘮𝘦??
Hmph.
Anyway...!
The thing about your boobs. I didn't mean it, okay?
That's all.
See??
That's not what happened at all!
Are you kidding?
That's exactly what I did!
It was 𝘩𝘦𝘳 that--
Nnn...!
You know what?
I'm going to do that.
It'll spare me from having to look at all your faces right now.
Well... That's her problem! This isn't about her.
𝘌𝘹𝘤𝘶𝘴𝘦 me?
Are you listening to yourself?
This is exactly why...
Exactly why nobody likes--
Be-Because...
Ahahaha!
I 𝘸𝘢𝘴 just gonna give it to you.
But then I heard you blab about the cupcakes.
It was totally worth seeing your reaction, though. Ahaha!
Ehehe.
You're going through a lot over just one cookie.
Jeez...
Beggars can't be choosers!
Yeah, why do you think I gave you that one?
Ah-- Jeez...
I get it, I get it.
𝘏-𝘏𝘦𝘺!!
Did you seriously just do that?!
Jeez! You're such a kid sometimes!
Monika! Can you tell Sayori--
--Eh?
Ugh...
Where's Monika, anyway?
Of course she's okay.
She probably just had something to do today.
She's pretty popular, after all...
Excuse me?!
That makes no sense, though.
You would have heard the bell ring, at least.
Is this about the festival?
Ugh. Do we really have to do something for the festival?
It's not like we can put together anything good in just a few days.
We'll just end up embarrassing ourselves instead of getting any new members.
Okay, that's great and all...
But that doesn't tell us what we're actually going to be doing for the event.
Performing?
Are you kidding me, Monika?
You didn't...you didn't already start putting those posters up, did you?
Well, no.
It's not a bad idea.
But I didn't sign up for this, you know!
There is 𝘯𝘰 way I'm going to be performing in front of a group of people like that!
Well...maybe, but...
Uu...
...Okay, fine!
I guess I'll just have to get it over with.
N-N-No way!!
Hmph.
Don't make me go before [player].
Don't make me go before [player].
Don't make me go before [player].
It's not like I can compare to you guys, anyway...
Might as well let [player] lower everyone's standards a little before I have to do it.
Might as well let [player] lower everyone's standards a little before I have to do it.
Might as well let [player] lower everyone's standards a little before I have to do it.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm going.
The poem is called...
It's called...
W-Why are you all looking at me?!
Hmph...
Anyway...the poem is called 𝘑𝘶𝘮𝘱.
Easy for you to say...
You'd better not make me do that again.
I mean, doing it in front of other people will be way easier!
I can put on whatever face I want for other people.
But when it's just my friends...
It's just...embarrassing.
Well, that's just how it is, so...
Look at you two, always going home together like that.
Seriously? You brought a boy?
Way to kill the atmosphere.
So, let me guess...
You're Monika's boyfriend, right?
Wait! Monika!
Didn't I tell you to let me know in advance before you brought anyone new?
I was going to...well, you know...
Well...
...I guess.
Ugh, I hate horror...
Well, I just...
Never mind.
W-What?
What gives you that idea?
Don't say it out loud!!
And give that back!
Eh? Well, I guess sometimes.
Why do you care?
N-No!
You wouldn't...like them...
...?
U-Um...
Hmph.
I mean, if you really just left after all this, I would be super pissed.
Oh, come on! Like he deserves any slack.
You already had to be dragged here by Monika.
I don't know if you plan to just come here and hang out, or what...
But if you don't take us seriously, then you won't see the end of it.
M-M-M...!!

See??
Just saying that proves my point!
Most people learn to get over themselves after they graduate middle school, you know.
Oh, my bad... You already do, don't you?
Yeah, go on!
Let [player] hear everything you really think!
Let [player] hear everything you really think!
Let [player] hear everything you really think!
I'm sure he'll be head over heels for you after this!
That's not true!
She started it!
Hey, have you guys seen Monika?
Man...
Jeez, this isn't like her at all.
I know it's stupid, but I can't help but worry a little bit...
What?
Why're you looking at me like that?
Did you do something yesterday?
Jeez...
Whatever's on your mind, I'm sure it was nothing.
I don't even remember anything bad happening.
You're the kind of person who worries too much about the little things, aren't you?
mibulls sailcloth blindsight lifeline anan rectipetality faultlessly offered scleromalacia neighed catholicate
I'll accept your apology anyway, if it helps you feel better about it.
Besides, it's kinda nice to hear, since I was always afraid you secretly hated me or something like that.
Ehehe.
Ahaha.
Well, you're kind of weird, but I don't hate you either.
You're still on trial, though.
I-I was not!!
...What took you so long, anyway?
That makes no sense, though.
You would have heard the bell ring, at least.
You should play something for us sometime!
Is this about the festival?
Ugh. Do we really have to do something for the festival?
It's not like we can put together anything good in just a few days.
We'll just end up embarrassing ourselves instead of getting any new members.
What's so great about getting new members, anyway?
We already have enough to be considered an official club.
More members will just mean everything gets noisier and more difficult to manage.
Oh, come on!
You can't take advantage of [player] to agree with you just because he doesn't know how to say no to anything.
You can't take advantage of [player] to agree with you just because he doesn't know how to say no to anything.
You can't take advantage of [player] to agree with you just because he doesn't know how to say no to anything.
Look, Monika.
Do you really think any of us here joined the club with other people in mind?
As for me, I just like it better here than I do at home.
And [player] isn't even passionate about literature in the first place.
And [player] isn't even passionate about literature in the first place.
And [player] isn't even passionate about literature in the first place.
And that's everyone.
Sorry, but you're really the only one who's so interested in finding new members.
The rest of us are fine like this.
I know you're President and all, but you should really consider our opinions for once.
What, me?
I just spoke my mind...
Is it a crime to be honest?
You don't understand at all!
I just...
I just want a place that feels nice to hang out with a few friends.
Is there a problem with the club being that for me?
There aren't...there aren't many other places like that for me...
And now Monika wants to take it away from me!
No, [player].
No, [player].
No, [player].
It's not the same.
It won't be the same with the direction she wants to take it.
If I wanted that, then I could have just joined any other stupid club.
But this one...
I mean...
At least for a little bit of time...
Things were nice.
I'm going home.
I feel like...I don't belong here right now.
Monika!
I told you not to--
Ugh...
Is she really late again?
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?!
You say that like I do it on a regular basis or something.
I just wasn't paying attention, okay? I'm sorry.
Seriously... What's gotten into you lately?
Look...
I did some thinking about yesterday.
I was a little more hostile than I meant to be...
I guess I really felt threatened or something.
But I know this is something we're doing together.
Another new member wouldn't hurt, as long as they're cool...
And I guess another girl would be nice this time...
So...
--!
See, it 𝘪𝘴 something.
Well, I just felt like I needed to bring it up.
It's not like I really care or anything...
Well, [player] just walked in too.
Well, [player] just walked in too.
Well, [player] just walked in too.
Ahahaha!
Sorry, that last part was really funny.
Look...
I did some thinking about yesterday.
I was a little more hostile than I meant to be...
I guess I really felt threatened or something.
But I know this is something we're doing together.
Another new member wouldn't hurt, as long as they're cool...
And I guess another girl would be nice this time...
...But more importantly, I would hate to see the event suck just because I chose to back out!
I'm a pro, you know!
So I'm gonna help too, and we'll make sure it's done right.
...Monika?
Jeez...
Why is the mood so weird today?
I want to make cupcakes!
Wait, you?
You have the easiest job, Monika!
Like hell it is!
What are you trying to pull?
Mine too!
Like 𝘺𝘰𝘶 would fucking know!
All you care about now is dragging [player] around with you and your stupid books.
All you care about now is dragging [player] around with you and your stupid books.

You 𝘢𝘯𝘥 Monika!
Okay, then why not let [player] decide who to help instead of abusing your power?

Jeez...
[player], I know how fed up you are with these two by now.
[player], I know how fed up you are with these two by now.

We can just--
𝘠𝘰𝘶 shut your mouth!
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?
This isn't fair at all!
Alright, it's festival time!
Wow, you got here before me?
I thought I was pretty ea-- EYAH!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!
Aaah, I can't wait for the festival!
It's gonna be great!
Well, yeah.
I'm not talking about 𝘰𝘶𝘳 part of the festival.
But it's a whole day of school where we get to play and eat all kinds of delicious food!
Monika! Do they usually have fried squid?
Oh, come on.
Are you saying you don't like squid?
You, of all people?
Because!
It's right in your name!
Mon-ika!
...?
Ehehe.
Fine, fine.
Hey, you.
Are you just gonna sit there and keep staring at nothing?
There isn't that much time, so...
I-It's not like I'm worried!
I was just...
Jeez...
Now you're making me feel like a jerk.
If something's bothering you, then you can just tell me to leave you alone, and I will.
I mean...
Assuming you didn't feel like talking about it or anything...
S-Sayori...?
Thinking about her...?
Oh...
Well, first of all...
You should really work on your phrasing!
But anyway...
You're her best friend, right?
Yeah.
Then in that case, I think you should trust her a little more.
If she needed you, then you would be the first person she would go to, right?
I mean, some people just have those days.
You can't always avoid it.
If anything, she probably doesn't want you to worry about her because it's not important.
Exactly.
If she needs you to worry about her, then it'll be a lot more obvious.
She...
She really means a lot to you, doesn't she...?
I was not!!
Jeez...if you're fine, then let's hurry and get started already!
Hold on a second!
Is it just me, or did you say something strange just now?
Jeez...
Why is the mood so weird today?
Where the heck did she run off to, anyway?
I thought she just went to pee.
Oh, come on.
Seriously?
Of all the times to not go home with her, you pick the time she's not feeling well?
So much for you two being all lovey-dovey.
I already know what 𝘐'𝘮 doing!
Challenge accepted!
...?
Well, even if you don't know how to bake, there's always some dirty work I could give to you.
It's not like Monika's going to give me a choice, and you shouldn't be sitting on your butt anyway...
Hold on! I never said that!
How hard could it be to make a few decorations, anyway?
Sounds more like you're just making excuses for [player] to--
Sounds more like you're just making excuses for [player] to--
Sounds more like you're just making excuses for [player] to--
And baking isn't?
Just what do you think--
You 𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 just said--
Jeez...
Can we just settle this already?
Hmph.
Monika said that Sayori was helping her!
Jeez...
Do you really hate us that much?
Hold on one second!
Monika, you're the one who needs the least help out of all of us!
That doesn't matter.
You were the one who scared him into picking you in the first place.
You're the club president, Monika.
You're supposed to make responsible decisions for the club!
𝘌𝘹𝘤𝘶𝘴𝘦 me?
Yeah!
We have a lot of work to do, you know!
We won't do as good of a job if you make us work alone.
So are you going to do the right thing, 𝘗𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘯𝘵?
Don't worry!
Baking is a ton of fun!
You'll definitely agree!
Th-That's because--!
...Never mind, okay?
So, that's everything, right?
Anything else we need to talk about?
Yes!
Everything except the performance is gonna be awesome!
She's still sulking.
It's not...
I mean, it's not that big of a deal or anything...
...?
That doesn't mean...
Uu...
Look...
You really are the most talented one here.
And...
And you're going to help make the event a lot more fun and welcoming.
I mean, the cupcakes will probably help a lot too...
But you're gonna make the atmosphere special.
That'll be really important for the way that people feel during the performances.
So...
You need to stop being dumb and give yourself a little more credit!
Um...
N-Not really, but...
Yeah.
Okay, but I'm staying here a bit longer.
I barely got to do any reading today, so...
Um, where are you going?
We still need to figure out our plans for this weekend.
You literally would've gotten home and realized that you didn't even have a way to contact me.
Jeez, good thing I stopped you.
I'm giving you my number, okay?
You'd better not make it weird or anything!
Hmph...
Okay...
I'm coming over on Sunday.
I'll bring all the ingredients.
Well, yeah.
What's wrong with that?
Yeah, right.
Like I could have a guy over my house...
My dad would kill me.
Yeah, how do you think I feel?
I can't do anything when my dad is home...
Anyway...I just needed to complain for a second.
We have each other's numbers now.
That's all I needed from you.
I guess I'll text you when I'm coming over.
Yeah.
I'm really gonna show you why I love baking so much.
So you'd better look forward to it.
Well--!
I was...just saying that.
It's not like I could act like...in front of everyone...
That I was looking forward to this.
Well, kind of!
Just because...I never got to bake with someone else before.
That's all it is, so...
Ah--
...Never mind.
Are you serious?
Why would you--
N-No...
I was just saying--
Ugh...
I mean, yeah.
I already said I would be fine.
What??
Why is everyone yelling at me?
I didn't even do anything...!
I get it, I get it.
I'm kinda surprised, though...
Um...
Well, I'm the one acting immature...
I already know that.
But you're trying to cheer me up all of a sudden...
No...
I kinda appreciated it.
I'm sorry...for making a big deal out of nothing.
But I'm going to say this.
You better bet that my cupcakes are going to be the best part of the whole event!
Alright, let's get out of here, then.
'Sup?
Jeez, don't make it feel so awkward already!
It's gonna be a long afternoon, so don't be weird just because you're not used to seeing me outside of school.
Anyway, I'm coming in.
Well, I didn't want to come all this way to find out that your kitchen isn't equipped for the job.
You bought everything I asked you to, right?
Good!
Glad I could count on you to do your part.
What, you're not even gonna offer to take this heavy bag from me?
Where's your hospitality, [player]?
Where's your hospitality, [player]?
Where's your hospitality, [player]?
Ahaha!
I carried that all the way here.
Are you impressed?
Ehehe~
It's because I'm so small, isn't it?
You jerk.
Eh?
Um...
It's not like I hate it...
I mean, sometimes I like proving people wrong when they only think I'm worth my size.
It's fun when I get to be small and also better than other people.
But...
...Jeez, never mind!
What are you making me say?
Don't think you can make me talk about weird things just because we're not at school!
Are we getting started, or what? There's a lot of stuff I gotta teach you.
What??
H-Hey!
Now you 𝘢𝘳𝘦 treating me like a kid!
I was just trying to be a little nicer to you, you know.
A-Ah--
Forget it!
I didn't say anything!
Eh?
Ah...
How would...you know that, anyway?
...Gross.
Who else?
Ahaha!
You get all sour when a girl calls you gross.
I finally found your weakness, [player].
I finally found your weakness, [player].
I finally found your weakness, [player].
[player], where did you put the food coloring?
[player], where did you put the food coloring?
[player], where did you put the food coloring?
The batter's going in the oven soon, so I need to fill the trays.
To color the batter, of course!
I'm making each tray a different color.
That way, even if the flavors aren't different, everyone can still pick their favorite.
Do you want to?
Come on...
You're not putting any heart into this at all!
Can't you at least try to have fun?
See?
It's not like baking is just about following instructions.
The presentation is where you get to be creative and have the most fun.
It's a million times more worth it in the end if just looking at it makes everyone's eyes lighten up.
Sounds like you're starting to understand.
Just make sure you completely finish mixing the icing before you mess with the food coloring.
Eh?
The icing's still all lumpy!
Are you even trying?
Jeez, I'll be here all night if you do it like that.
Here, look.
You really need to...beat...the crap out of it!
See?
Hey!
I don't want 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 gross fingers in my icing.
Don't make me beat the crap out of you next!
Gross!
You got it on my face!
Nnn--
Jeez...
You know what?
Take this!
Ahahaha! Stop!
Fine, fine!
I'm sorry for calling you gross.
You know I don't mean it.
It's just fun seeing you react to it.
...You do that to me all the time, you know!
Saying dumb things just to get a reaction out of me.
You really shouldn't tease girls like that.
W-W-What--?
D-Did you seriously just--
A-Ah--
[player]...
[player]...
[player]...
You really shouldn't do that kind of thing to girls...unless you really like them...
You know that...right?
Eh?!
*𝘊𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩*
No wonder...
You left a dirty tray in here, dummy!
How could you make a mistake like that?
Don't blame me for your mistakes!
Jeez...
Anyway...
I'm...putting them in the oven now.
Ahh, that smells so good!
Look at how cute they all look!
Not like you need to tell 𝘮𝘦 that!
I brought decorating stuff, so I hope you can get creative.
Here, scoop the icing into these bags.
I have these nozzles that will make it look nice and fluffy.
This one can even make flowers!
We probably won't be using it this time, though.
That one's really thin, so you can use it to make stripes or other patterns.
But you can also use it to write stuff on a cake.
Like, 'happy birthday!' or whatever.
Eh?
Uu...
I was kind of expecting you to say something really stupid...
But that's actually...a really cute idea, so...
W-What's that supposed to mean?
I'm not cute!
W-Well...
Same with you...
N-No, nothing!
Let's just do the icing!
There's a lot to do, so we shouldn't be wasting time!
Here, I'll show you how to do it.
Look at how pretty they are together!
Uu... I wish I could have one now!
Well, yeah, but...
My dad's making dinner tonight, so I really need to save my appetite.
Come on, that's just unhealthy!
Besides, when my dad cooks, I need to eat as much of it as I can...
...Well, anyway!
I was hoping we would have time for manga, but I need to be home for dinner...
It's your fault for working so slowly!
You should have thought about that.
It's not like you'll always have this chance.
You can bring the cupcakes tomorrow, right?
If you and Sayori each carry some, then you can probably do it in one trip.
Ahaha.
I wish she would listen to me the way she listens to you.
Okay, I'm all packed up.
Good work today!
Well...
I guess I'll be off, then...
Thanks for all the help and everything...
I'll see you tomorrow.
Eh?
Um--
Do you...really mean that?
[player]...
[player]...
[player]...
I thought you only cared about getting this done...
Uu...
I'm sorry I had to leave so early today.
I really didn't want to!
I would really...stay here longer if I could.
I feel the same way as you, so...
I've felt it...
For a while now...
--!!
S-Sayori?!
A-Ah...
Well...
Y-You should have come a little earlier!
I'm already on my way out, so...
Yeah, well...
I'll still see you at the festival tomorrow, so it's fine.
Just don't eat any cupcakes before then!
Anyway, later!
Huh.
So you're the [player] that Sayori's always talking about?
So you're the [player] that Sayori's always talking about?
So you're the [player] that Sayori's always talking about?
No need to be so formal.
He's gonna think we're really strict or something...
Ehehe.
Well, if Sayori is this happy, then I'm sure it won't be so bad to have you around.
Hey, don't ruin the surprise!
Everyone sit down at the table, okay?
Okaaay, are you ready?
...Ta-daa!
Ehehe. Well, you know.
Just hurry and take one!
W-Well...of course it is!
I'm a pro, after all!
There's no need to thank me or anything...
Well, about...you know, the first thing he said...
D-Don't just say it!!
Besides...
Manga...is literature too, you know?
So...if [player] wants to read some of my manga, then don't try to stop him or anything!
So...if [player] wants to read some of my manga, then don't try to stop him or anything!
So...if [player] wants to read some of my manga, then don't try to stop him or anything!
Yeah...
You're right as usual, President.
Guess that means I should try picking up a novel or something, huh...?
Jeez...
You were the one who suggested we diversify!
You should be a little more open-minded...
It's kind of hurtful...
...Are you just saying that?
Really?!
I-I mean...
You can trust me to find something that you'll really like, okay?
Just...just you?
Um...
If you don't mind...
Yeah, me too...
I'll show you some manga there too, okay?
Ugh...!
Freaking Monika...
She never puts my stuff back in the right spot!
What's the point in keeping your collection organized if someone else is just gonna mess it up?
You read manga, right?
I heard you bring it up at some point.
Besides, it's kind of written on your face.
𝘛𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 it is!
Aah, much better!
Seeing a box set with one book missing is probably the most irritating sight in the world.
If you're gonna judge, you can go do it through the glass on that door.
It was the tone of your voice.
But I'll tell you one thing, [player].
But I'll tell you one thing, [player].
But I'll tell you one thing, [player].
Consider this a lesson straight from the Literature Club: Don't judge a book by its cover!
In fact--
I'm gonna show you exactly why!
Don't just stand there!
Chairs wouldn't work.
We can't read at the same time like that.
--!
D-Don't just say that!
You'll make me feel weird about it!
Wow, how long has it been since I read the beginning...?
Not really.
Maybe sometimes after I've already finished the series.
Hey, are you paying attention?
Well, obviously!
You think I would enjoy something that didn't have a plot?
I mean...
Well, I guess I know what you're saying...
A lot of the beginning is about simple things...
Like there's a really funny chapter where they're obsessed with a guy at the ice cream shop...
But that just helps you get to know the characters!
And besides, it's still entertaining.
But later on, there's all kinds of drama...
Like when they get into all their backstories, and when some of the romance starts to happen...
That's really what makes it so good.
There are so many touching parts.
Ehehe.
...Hey, wait!
What's 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 supposed to mean?!
Hmph. Good save.
Well--
...Yeah.
Why does that matter?
That's--
Just a coincidence!
I just happened to get into baking around the same time I got this manga.
Like I would ever get into anything because it's in a manga.
I feel bad for anyone that impressionable.
Ahaha!
It's not!
Well...!
I'm...fine with that.
...?
Um...
That's not...
Well, I wouldn't really know.
Could you not rub it in?
Jeez...
Hmph.
Like I could ever get my friends to read this...
They just think manga is for kids.
I can't even bring it up without them being all like...
'Eh? You still haven't grown out of that yet?'
Makes me want to punch them in the face...
Hm.
Yeah, that's pretty accurate.
I mean, I feel like I can't even keep it in my own room...
I don't even know what my dad would do if he found this.
At least it's safe here in the clubroom.
'Cept Monika was kind of a jerk about it...
Ugh! I just can't win, can I?
Well, it's not like that solves any of my problems.
...So?
Jeez, that's enough!
Are you gonna keep reading, or what?
Ahahaha!
I totally forgot that happens!
Minori is my favorite character.
You always feel a little bad for her, since she's so unlucky.
But it gets especially bad when--
Uu...
I shouldn't be talking about that yet!
Just finish this chapter!
Oh, come on!
Could your timing be any worse?
Eh...?
A-Ah!
You're just giving it back...?
Don't you want to know what happens?
Don't be dumb.
Just take it home with you.
Well, of course.
It would take forever to finish if you didn't take it home.
Just finish that one before tomorrow, so we can start the next one.
And if it gets bent, I'll kill you.
I just wanted to make sure!
Can you blame me for being paranoid?
I don't give people my manga every day, you know.
Well anyway, let me put this one back.
I'm gonna get the next one, okay?
So you're gonna tell me everything you thought, right??
Where did this volume leave off again? I forget.
𝘔𝘰𝘯𝘪𝘬𝘢!!
Did you move my manga again?!
Ugh...
Jeez...!
This is so inconvenient!
I'm moving these all back down.
There's plenty of room on these shelves.
And besides...
They're really pretty to look at when they're all lined up!
Why would you waste that on the top shelf?
I can get them myself!
You think I'm too short or something?
I 𝘬𝘯𝘦𝘸 it!
Well, you know what?
Just watch me!
A-Ah...
I know what I'm doing!!
U-Uuuh...
See...?
Kyah--!
Wawaa--
T-There!
I said I can do it!
I don't want your help, okay?
I'm gonna get a chair, so just hang on.
Let's see...
Aha!
Ush--
Aha! There we go!
See? I can easily do it now.
W-Wahh--
What are you doing??
Can you at least hold the chair steady instead of sitting and doing nothing?
Hup--
Uu...heavy...
Hey, [player]...
Hey, [player]...
Hey, [player]...
I-I don't think I can bend down without falling...!
Hurry and take this one...
That's fine...!
Just for a second!
Hurry up...
What do you mean 'stand up'?
Why are you all the way back--
E-Eh...?
𝘞-𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘵?!
You're trying to look at my...m-my...
You...you perv!
You set me up!!
Go away!
Get out!
I'll do it myself!!
A-Ah--
𝘒𝘺𝘢𝘢𝘢𝘢𝘢!
U-Uu...
Eh...?
G-Guuuuu...!!
Gross! Gross!
What were you thinking?!
You sicko!
Monika!
See what happens when you put the manga on the top shelf?!
Are you trying to kill your club members or something?
Jeez!
Oh, and one more thing.
It seems like your most recent club member is a total pervert.
So I hope you're happy.
Oh no...!
My...my...
*𝘚𝘰𝘣*
No!
No...
I don't even care that much...
I'm just...
Having a really bad day today...
I didn't mean to take it out on you...
I really didn't mean to!
Just...
Every day...
...is...so hard.
I just want to...
...come to the club and...
You're...
You're really nice to me...
Nn...
T-Thanks...
Good.
Even if you weren't, I'd make you anyway.
You're taking responsibility for what you said.
The thing about cheering me up.
Yep!
Even you sound more enthusiastic this time.
Ehehe.
Told you.
Ugh...!

Ugh! I just can't win, can I?
Well, it's not like that solves any of my problems.
...So?
Jeez, that's enough!
Are you gonna keep reading, or what?
Y-Yeah...?
I told you not to give mmph...
Yeah...
I told you that you weren't gonna like it.
What?
Just be honest!
Well--
Because!
Everyone in high school thinks that writing has to be all sophisticated and stuff...
So people don't even take my writing seriously.
Yes! Exactly!
I like when it's easy to read, but it hits you hard.
Like in this poem.
Seeing everyone around you do great things can be really disheartening...
So I decided to write about it.
But the other nice thing about simple writing is that it puts more weight on the wordplay.
Like I set up for a rhyme at the end, but then made it fall flat on purpose.
It helps bring out the feeling in the last line.
That's what it means to be a pro!
I'm glad you learned something.
Didn't expect that from the youngest one here, did you?
Not bad, right?
Yesterday's was way too short...
I was just warming up!
I hope you didn't think that was the best I could do.
Anyway, the message is pretty straightforward in this poem.
I doubt I have to explain it.
Sometimes you can explain complicated issues with much simpler analogies...
And it helps people realize how stupid they're being.
Like, anyone would agree that the subject of this poem is an ignorant jerk...
Of course. It's about how everyone thinks my--
...That doesn't matter! It can be about anything!
I wrote it to be easy to relate to...
Everyone has some kind of weird hobby, or a guilty pleasure.
Something that you're afraid if people find out, they'd make fun of you or think less of you.
...But that just makes people stupid!
Who cares what someone likes, as long as they're not hurting anyone, and it makes them happy?
I think people really need to learn to respect others for liking weird things...
Huh?
Really?
Well...
...Not that there's anything wrong with that!
Uu...
It's not like...I would judge her or anything...
I-I guess I should try not to be so mean to her...
If she feels insecure about her weird behaviors and stuff...
I mean, I always hate people who make me feel insecure...
But the way you put it, it sounds like she's learned her lesson...
You know...
I'm glad that you can appreciate this kind of writing...
I mean...I know I was talking about that yesterday.
But I've been...well, I've been enjoying sharing my writing with you, so...
...So consider yourself lucky, okay?
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm always honest!
Jeez...
Just look forward to tomorrow too, okay?
It's what I do best, after all!
I don't like writing unless there's a good message to take away from it.
Like, conveying emotions is important...
But I want to make people think, not just feel.
Remember that!
I'm gonna write a good one for tomorrow, too, so look forward to it.
Yeah...
I felt like I kept writing about negative things, so I wanted to write something with a nice message for once.
Besides...the beach is awesome!
Kinda hard to write anything negative about the beach.
Yeah, well...
It's only because of what happened yesterday.
She wanted to pick a topic and have us both write about it, or whatever.
Well, that's--
Jeez...she better not have said anything bad about mine!
After all, she was the one who wanted us to write about the same topic.
Ugh...you can really see her doing that, too.
Making us write about a simple topic, then trying to impress me by coming up with something all fancy.
Well, it's not like I care.
I just did it anyway.
I mean, I guess mine ended up being kind of metaphorical too...
...But there's nothing wrong with doing that once in a while!
At the very least, it was good practice.
...Why are you looking at me like that?
If you don't like it, then just say it.
I won't...get mad.
D-Don't just say that!
Dummy...
What do you think...the point of writing is?
Expressing things that you can't just say...
Well...yeah...
I'm...I'm a pro, so...
Just...
Remember that...I can think these things sometimes, too!
You know, when you're nice to me, it's...
...Meaningful.
I don't want it.
I just don't!
Jeez...
...Good.
If you didn't, I would...
Never mind...
Just...I'm glad that you want it.
That's all for now, so...
Go put it away before someone sees it, okay?
[player], if you're not going to take this club seriously then go home.
[player], if you're not going to take this club seriously then go home.
[player], if you're not going to take this club seriously then go home.
What, you expect me to believe that you actually put effort into this?
Do you think I'm stupid?
Fine.
Well, sorry.
You'll get better, anyway.
I'd tell you what to improve, but you're better off just trying again.
Anyway, I guess I gotta share mine now...
Knowing you, you'll probably think it's stupid.
...Well, it's about what I expected from someone like you.
Well, excuse me.
It's not like I said it was bad.
It just didn't evoke any emotions.
Do you want to get smacked?
Sigh...
Well anyway, I guess I need to show you mine.
Not that you'll like it.
...Okay, well let's start with the things I don't like!
First of all, um...
N-Never mind. I don't feel like giving you my opinion.
Uu...
Uuuu...!
Well I would be more comfortable sharing my poem if yours was really bad!
You were supposed to show me some dumb poem and make me go 'Hah, well it's not that great but let me show you what real literature looks like!'
And you went and ruined it!
I hope you're happy!
Urk--
Uuuuuuuuu...You're so...!
You just...you...don't understand anything, do you?
I already told you that, you don't have to go announcing it to the world like you're all self-important!
Gr... Fine, I guess.
Only because Monika will make me if I don't.
...Hm.
Well, I can admit that it's better than the last one.
It's nice to see that you're putting in some effort.
But I still don't like this at all.
It's trying too hard to be serious.
Poems don't need to be all deep-sounding to express something.
It's going to just sound like you're forcing it unless you really don't suck at it.
D-Don't...tell me...
Uu....!!
I am so done with you.
Take your stupid poem. If you wrote it for someone else, just don't show it to me!
...Hm.
I liked your last one better.
Well yeah. I can tell you were a little more daring with this one.
But you're really not good enough for that yet. It fell flat.
I mean, I always like poems that aren't trying too hard.
I hate when people try to sound fancy or add more meaning just by using annoying and complicated language.
Just make it simple, cute, and to the point!
Making your reader look so hard for all this deep meaning is just an excuse to have no meaning at all.
Well, everyone has their own opinion.
But my opinion is the best opinion. I'm sure you've figured that out already.
Anyway, here's my poem. Maybe you'll learn something.
...Hm.
Well, I can admit that it's better than the last one.
It's nice to see that you're putting in some effort.
Come to think of it, this kind of reminds me of Sayori's poem from yesterday...
Yeah. Well I guess if you've been friends with her for so long, you might be on the same wavelength.
But you never really struck me as her type.
Well, I don't know! But honestly, how can someone so...er, fluffy...spend so much time with someone like you?
It's like she's dragging around a dead weight.
Whatever it is, I don't get it...
...Oh, yeah, I guess I'm supposed to show you my poem.
Here.
...Hm.
Well, it's not really any worse than your last one.
But I can't really say it's any better, either.
Huh? 'Phew' what?
H-Hey! What makes you--
(𝘞𝘢𝘪𝘵, 𝘮𝘢𝘺𝘣𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘢 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵...?)
A-Ahah! Glad to see someone recognizes my experience!
Well then, keep practicing and maybe you'll be as good as me someday!
...Hm.
Well, it's not terrible.
But it's pretty disappointing after your last one.
Then again, if this one was as good as your last one, I would be completely pissed.
Fair enough. You're still new to this, so I wouldn't expect you to find your style right away.
...Aren't you supposed to be bad at this?
N-No! I mean... You know...
I just...expected a lot less after what you showed me yesterday.
That's all.
Y-Yeah!! Exactly!
You just got lucky, you know?
Don't get used to it.
You won't always manage to write poems this cute. I mean--!
I mean well-written! No, I mean--
No! Why are you smiling?! It's not like I like cute things!
H-Huh! Reading it again, I decided that it's not so great after all.
It's too cute and doki-doki.
It would only impress...you know, girls...who like those kinds of things.
Ahaha!
Well, anyway...!
You're gonna read mine now, right?
Judging by your tastes, you'll probably like it a lot.
You'll probably learn something, too. Don't forget who the 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭 pro is.
Rrgh...
No! No, it's not!
It's good. It's really good, okay?!
There, I said it!
Ugh, this wasn't supposed to happen at all...!
Why can't you just be bad at this?
My poems are supposed to impress 𝘺𝘰𝘶, not the other way around!
Give me a break.
I'll tell you! You--
Y-Y-You...
You're trying to...impress 𝘮𝘦?
I...have to use the bathroom!
Hey!
Did you read this, Monika?
Ugh...
You should really stop reading things that aren't for you, you know.
You have a bad habit of doing that.
Uu--
Okay, well, I think [player] is done sharing this poem with everyone.
It's not like anyone would want to read this anyway.
In fact, I'm just going to hold onto this.
What?
Why are you looking at me like that??
Ugh...
Never mind.
So what?
...Fine.
It's not like she's going to like it, though.
Anyway, read my poem now.
And no, I won't let you keep it.
This is my only copy.
Yeah, no thanks.
𝘕𝘦𝘹𝘵!
...Meh.
I guess you really haven't learned anything after all.
Honestly, I don't know why I got my hopes up in the first place.
Oh, man.
This is seriously a step backwards.
I liked your last two way better than this one.
I mean...
I guess I can't be mad at you for trying different things.
Gross.
...Eh?
N-No! Gross!
It's not like I care!
It's just that 𝘰𝘯𝘦 of us in this club has to make sure you're not slacking off.
That's--um...
...It's not like you would actually do that.
Oh?
Maybe I won't mind scaring you away after all.
Oh, I know!
Don't worry, I was too.
Ahahaha!
Anyway...
...This one's alright.
Well, yeah.
It doesn't blow me away.
But there's nothing I really hate about it.
It's just not really my style. I mean, that's fine.
...This one's alright.
Well, yeah.
About as good as yesterday's, anyway.
I see what you're going for, but it's just not really my style.
I mean, that's fine.
I'm mostly just glad that you're trying a little bit.
Let's see, let's see!
Of course.
You know I like your writing.
Well... Well, of course!
I just had to put you in your place a little bit!
It's not like...
I mean, it's not like I was shy or anything stupid like that.
Or jealous!
I really wasn't jealous.
Just because you happen to be a good writer?
That's such a dumb thing to get jealous about.
Ahaha!
What??
...Eh?
W-What are you talking about?
My writing is obviously the best...
...Right?
Right...?
[player]...
Please just tell me you like my poems.
I don't care if you hate them.
Just please tell me I'm the best.
I just...
I just really need to hear that from someone.
I know I sound stupid.
But there's a reason I never shared my poems before this.
Because...
Because nobody ever takes me seriously!
What's the point in sharing my poems if people just laugh and say \"That's so cute, just like you, Natsuki!\"
Sometimes I don't want to be cute!
But nobody understands that!
I try really hard when I write.
The style doesn't matter.
The emotions are there.
Why can't anyone 𝘴𝘦𝘦 that...?
I just want...
D-Don't read it!
It's not any good.
And I know you hate my poems.
So you don't have to read this one, okay?
W-Why?
You can...read it.
Just turn that way.
I don't want you to...look at my face right now.
...Finally!
This one. It's good!
I was wondering how long it would take you.
Yeah, seriously.
Don't listen to what anyone else says.
Just keep writing poems like this. That's all you need!
Excuse me?
You're talking to a pro, you know.
Don't you think you should trust my opinion the most?
Biased?
Of course not.
My opinion just happens to be the best.
Ahaha!
I knew you'd finally understand.
Just keep showing me your poems and you'll be a pro before you know it.
Anyway, here's the one I wrote.
Not bad, right?
Yesterday's was way too short...
I was just warming up!
I hope you didn't think that was the best I could do.
Anyway, the message is pretty straightforward in this poem.
I doubt I have to explain it.
Like, anyone would agree that the subject of this poem is an ignorant jerk...
Everyone has some kind of weird hobby, or a guilty pleasure.
Something that you're afraid if people find out, they'd make fun of you or think less of you.
...But that just makes people stupid!
Who cares what someone likes, as long as they're not hurting anyone, and it makes them happy?
I think people really need to learn to respect others for liking weird things...
...Such as two of the girls in this very club, whom I respectfully won't name.
Kind of ironic that even in my one place of comfort, I can't even have people respect me...
...Jeez, now you're making me complain too much!
Well--
I guess thanks...
Whatever... We're done sharing, so you can leave now.
[player]...
[player]...
[player]...
Why didn't you come read with me today?
I was waiting for you.
I was waiting for a long time.
It was the only thing I had to look forward to today.
Why did you ruin it?
I think you're better off not associating with her.
Are you listening to me?
That should be obvious by now.
So just play with me instead.
Okay?
You don't hate me, [player], do you?
You don't hate me, [player], do you?
You don't hate me, [player], do you?
Do you hate me?
Do you want to make me go home crying?
The club is the only place I feel safe.
Don't ruin that for me.
Don't ruin it.
Please.
Play with me instead.
It's all I have...
Play with me.
PLAY WITH ME!!!
I changed my mind.
Ignore everything you just read.
There's no point in trying to do anything.
Can you hear me, [player]?
Can you hear me, [player]?
Can you hear me, [player]?
If you would just spend more time with Monika, all these problems would go away.
Just think of Monika from now on.
Just Monika.
Yeah, just as I thought...
[player], come on.
[player], come on.
[player], come on.
I'm not stupid.
It's obvious that you care more about impressing her than trying to improve your writing.
To put it bluntly, it's kind of pathetic.
Why are you even in this club, [player]?
Why are you even in this club, [player]?
Why are you even in this club, [player]?
Honestly...
I thought getting a new member would help everyone get more involved together.
Not exclude each other even more.
This is such a stupid activity anyway...
...Look, I'm not in a good mood today, and I just really don't feel like talking right now.
Please go away.
...Hm.
I liked your last one better.
Well yeah. I can tell you were a little more daring with this one.
But you're really not good enough for that yet. It fell flat.
...Hm.
Well, I can admit that it's better than the last one.
It's nice to see that you're putting in some effort.
Just make sure you find a little bit of influence from everyone.
I mean, I know you've been, like...
Spending some time with her, or whatever...
But you know, Monika and I are just as good as her!
A-At poems, I mean!
So you should really try to learn something, or you'll never get better!
Here's the one I wrote...
I'll make sure you learn something from it.
...Hm.
Well, it's not really any worse than your last one.
But I can't really say it's any better, either.
Huh? 'Phew' what?
H-Hey! What makes you--
(𝘞𝘢𝘪𝘵, 𝘮𝘢𝘺𝘣𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘢 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵...?)
A-Ahah! Glad to see someone recognizes my experience!
Well then, keep practicing and maybe you'll be as good as me someday!
...Hm.
Well, it's not terrible.
But it's pretty disappointing after your last one.
Then again, if this one was as good as your last one, I would be completely pissed.
Fair enough. You're still new to this, so I wouldn't expect you to find your style right away.
I mean, everyone in the club writes really differently from each other...
Maybe you'll find a little influence from all of us.
For instance...
Not that I care who you spend your time with.
After all, I was taught never to expect anything from anybody.
So it's not like I was waiting for you, or anything.
Still, you should at least look over my poem...
You'll probably be able to learn something from it.
But I'm still going to make you read mine.
There's a reason.
I really wish I didn't have to do this...
But unfortunately I don't have much of a choice.
Just...read it carefully, okay?
Then you can go away.
...Meh.
I guess you really haven't learned anything after all.
Honestly, I don't know why I got my hopes up in the first place.
I didn't realize you were so impressionable.
Spending all this time with her in the club...
Now trying to write like her...
This is stupid.
At least Monika appreciates my writing...
...Ugh.
Okay...I guess I'm going to share my poem with you now.
I really hate that I have to do this.
But unfortunately I don't have much of a choice.
Just...read it carefully, okay?
Then you can go away.
Oh, man.
This is seriously a step backwards.
I liked your last two way better than this one.
...This one's alright.
Yeah, it's at least better than yesterday's.
I still can't really tell how much you actually care about writing, but either way, you're doing alright.
I still think it's nice to have activities that we all participate in.
So you better keep working hard!
I mean...
I know I'm not President or Vice President or anything...
But that doesn't mean you can let me down, okay?
So, at least read mine too for now.
But just to be clear...
This poem...means a lot to me.
So read it carefully, okay?
...This one's alright.
Well, yeah.
About as good as yesterday's, anyway.
What?
Gross!
What is with you two?
Hmph...
It's not like I wanted to read it anyway.
It's just pissing me off a little bit that you didn't even think to show me at all.
...Ugh.
Okay...I guess I'm going to share my poem with you anyway.
I really hate that I have to do this.
But unfortunately I don't have much of a choice.
Just...read it carefully, okay?
Then you can go away.
